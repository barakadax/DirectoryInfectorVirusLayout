# Virus-layout
Layout for self replicating virus.<br>
2 files which are the same, one is just easier to read the other is a mess.<br>
Both solves issues of codec with binary reading & writing.<br>
Both self replicate into files in the same directory & files inside child directory,<br>
only from the running code directory it can self replicate itself into other python files.<br>
Code won't duplicate into a python file, only into none infected files.<br>
